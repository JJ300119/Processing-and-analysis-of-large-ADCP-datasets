# Processing-and-analysis-of-large-ADCP-datasets
This document will guide you through the steps necessary to process and analyse both vessel mounted (VM-ADCP) and lowered acoustic doppler current profilers (L-ADCP). Both are complex data sources that contain a lot of noise and potential biases, but dont despair, with todays programms and code packages anyone can work with this data and produce meaningfull results.
