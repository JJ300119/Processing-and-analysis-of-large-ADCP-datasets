    "# Processing and analysis of vessel mounted and lowered ADCP datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "This document will guide you through the steps necessary to process and  analyse both vessel mounted (VM-ADCP) and lowered acoustic doppler current profilers (L-ADCP). Both are complex data sources that contain a lot of noise and potential biases, but dont despair, with todays programms and code packages anyone can work with this data and produce meaningfull results. \n",

    "This section explains how ADCP data was gathered during each expedition.\n",

    "## VM-ADCP\n",
    "\n",
    "The VM-ADCP is usualy mounted in the ships hull or a retractable keel, and connected to an onboard PC. To record data one of two proramms is usually used: The Windows programm VMDAS (Vesse mounted data aquisition system) from RDI instruments or the open source suite UHDAS from the University of Hawaii. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"vmdas.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we used VMDAS to collect VM-ADCP data. After starting up the PC and ensuring the PC is properly connected to the ADCP and the ships navigation channels, one can open the VMDAS and select the button: File--> Collect Data. This will open some empty diagrams. The next step is to edit the data options under: Options --> Edit data options. In the first section \"Communications\" the ADCP and NMEA (navigation) data channels need to be set to the right ports, but the ships technician likely did this already. In the next section \"ADCP setup\" you need to select the bin number and size. This depends on the frequency of the ADCP. We used 100 bins with a binsize of 8 m and 8 ms paceing between the bins. The ADCP also requires a specific set up file, which states details of the ADCPs mounting and ping-ing patters. This is usually avialable from the ships technician or stored on the data collection PC. Here is an example from RV Helmer Hanssen:\n"
